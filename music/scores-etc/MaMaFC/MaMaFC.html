<h1>Ma-Ma FC</h1>
<hr>
    This page is a guide to learning 
    <i>Ma-Ma FC</i> on a tapping instrument such as the
    Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and 
    (to be done) youtube video instructions, that will help you along the
    way. 

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. In fact, you can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the Fretboard diagrams, and playing the song on 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/16367332'>
    the Musecore web page.</a>

<h2>A bit of background about the piece</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a Riff Oriented Piece similar in style to tradtional west african (e.g. Mali) 
        music. It's in the Key of Bb Major. On the Melody side you may regard it as employing F Mixolydian
        (the 5th mode of Bb Major) in parts of the song (such as the intro).
