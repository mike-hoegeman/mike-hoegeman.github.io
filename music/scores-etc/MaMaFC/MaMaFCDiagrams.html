<h2>Diagrams for playing Ma-Ma FC</h2>
<hr>
<blockquote>
    Note: Each of these diagrams is in 
    <a target="popup"
    href="12_string_MR.jpg">12 string matched reciprocal
    tuning.</a> It will have link to a <code>.fbjson</code> file that
    you can download and then use in conjunction with

    <a  target="popup"
        href="https://mike-hoegeman.github.io/fretboard_diagrammer/fretboard.html">
        Fretboard diagammer web app</a>

    You can read the file into it and change the tuning in the
    tuning configuration drop down and it will make a (simple minded)
    try at converting it.

<h2>By Section Diagrams</h2>

<hr>
<h4>Key Signature</h4> 
    <p>
    The song is in Bb Major, with the flavor being that of F
    Mixolydian, the fith mode of Bb Major.  Here's a sort of heat
    map of the fretboard where you will usually be hitting notes.

<hr>
<h4>Section A</h4> 
    <p>
    This is the main backing riff for the song. this pattern is
    repeated each bar. If you play this as a duo you will play the
    riff throughout with embellishments on the melody side. You can
    play the low F instead of the Low C every 4 or 8 measures.
    <p>
    Once you are comfortable playing the basic 4 note riff on the
    bass side try holding down your first finger sounding the first
    F while doing a <i>pulloff tap</i> on the G (thus sounding the
    G and the second F note) and then tapping the C

    Note: All the ensuing sections have the same constant bass side pattern
    found in Section A so they are omitted and only the melody side
    of the fretboard is diagrammed

<hr> <h4>Section B</h4>
    <p> This is more a 4 bar rythmn than a Riff , Just one note Bb
    at
    it's core but you can mix a third above, a D for the last note in the bar
    with Bb.  I typically do that on the 3rd bar. Note in the Musecscore
    that you alternate between the first and second finger when
    sounding the Bb (leading with the first)

<hr> <h4>Section X</h4>
    <p>
    This riff is played after parts A and B

<hr> <h4>Section C</h4>
    <p>
    Alternate between Bb abd D on each bar and change it up with 
    playing G Bb for the last two notes in the bar to taste.
