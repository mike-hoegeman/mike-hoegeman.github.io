A tribute to the migration that so many animalsstill rely onfor
their survival and that humans undertookfor millenia long before
the confinesof our modern day borders when our ancestors travelled,
met and learned from each other, along the trade routes. sharing
knowledge, culture and music.

What Better metaphor and symbol for this creative calling and
migration than that master of songbirds, the Nightengale or Sorofe`
Kono in Bambara, a bird that travels every year from west Africa
to Europe to make its home, equally, on both continents.
