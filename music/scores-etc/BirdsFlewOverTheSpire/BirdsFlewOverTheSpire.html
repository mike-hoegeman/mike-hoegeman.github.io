<h1>Birds Flew Over The Spire</h1>
<hr>
    This page is a guide to learning 
    <a href="https://garyryan.co.uk/">Gary Ryan</a>'s song
    <i>Birds Flew Over The Spire</i> on a tapping instrument such as the
    Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and 
    (to be done) youtube video instructions, that will help you along the
    way. 

<h2>A bit of background about the piece</h2>


    <ul>
        <li>
        Birds Flew Over The Spire is the third of a three piece suite entitlted
        <i>City Scenes</i>
        </li>

	<li>Take a listen to a few versions of this piece.
        <a href='https://www.instagram.com/stephjonesguitar/reel/C6s6woeIh3_/'>
	This version</a> by the wonderful Stephanie Jones, is the
	most noteable I think.

    </ul>

<h2>Musescore score with tabs</h2>
    <p>
    The Score (and tabs) to go along with the diagrams below is available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/16734637'>Here</a>.
    even if you can't read music well (or at all), Bringing up the 
    score is </b>very useful</b>. <b>I can't emphasize this enough</b>... why?
    <ul>
    <li>you can play/loop a range of measures (phrase) in the score </li>
    <li>view the diagram associated with those measures </li>
    <li>play along with the loop until you've got the phrase down</li>
    </ul>

    Even if you don't use the same tuning as the one the score/diagrams.
    the shapes in the diagram will generally be the same. so you
    can go a long way with those resources even with a different
    tuning
    <!--
    <p>
    Throughout the instructions i also have links to Musescores
    that contain broken out parts of the main score to make it
    easier to bring up and loop on

<h2>The Song</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The piece is in E Major throughout.

        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
	The Score calls for a "Floating and Serene" rubato. Stephanie's
        <a href='https://www.instagram.com/stephjonesguitar/reel/C6s6woeIh3_/'>
	interpretation 
        </a> accomplishes this wonderfully and allows the
	beauty of this piece to shine though. 
        <p>
        <br>
	I've added some fermata and ritartando symbols to my
	arrangement to emphasize this. I've also slowed the tempo
	from 120 to 85, since I find it has a more contemplative feel at this
	reduced pace, which I like.
