Four Comets (1)

<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning the 1st song in a four song suite of miniatures by 
    Ralph Towner called
    <i>Four Comets</i> on a tapping Instrument
    such as the <a href='https://stick.com/'>Chapman Stick</a> or the acoustic 
    <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Dragonflytap'</a>Dragonfly DFA</a>.
    <p>
    This is one of Ralph's shortest and simplest pieces and is a
    good choice and is much less daunting than most of his compositions.
    It still has a very nice atmospheric feel (pun intended :) ). 

    <p>
    I added a four bar intro & bass section as a (very) minimal harmonic
    skeleton to go along with the original single voice melody
    written by Ralph. Feel free omit or alter them.
    The accel. , ret. & tempo markings are also suggestions,
    although they do vaguely follow the feel on
