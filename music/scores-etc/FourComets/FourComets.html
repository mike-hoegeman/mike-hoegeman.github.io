Four Comets (1)
</h1><img src='comet1.jpg'></img>
<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning the the four song suite of miniatures by 
    Ralph Towner called
    <i>Four Comets</i> on a tapping Instrument
    such as the <a href='https://stick.com/'>Chapman Stick</a> or the acoustic 
    <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Dragonflytap'</a>Dragonfly DFA</a>.

    <p>
    These are some of Ralph's shortest and simplest pieces and is
    a good choice for someone at beginner / intermediate level as
    it is much less daunting than most of his compositions (expecially
    part 1).  But they still have a very nice atmospheric feel (pun intended
    :) ).

    <p>
    I added a four bar intro & a bass section as a (very) minimal harmonic
    skeleton to go along with the original single voice melody
    written by Ralph. Feel free omit or alter them.
    The accel. , ret. & tempo markings are also suggestions,
    although they do vaguely follow the feel on
    <a href='https://youtu.be/mtXfiPl8lmc?si=-6Xqsf_D3sTBdN5T'>Ralph's version</a>

    <p>
    You will notice the added chord symbols are playing at a subdued
    level. They are a Bass Trombone (chord ensemble) voice in musescore
    that is run through a subtle UA galaxy (roland space) echo plugin. So,
    you can have a person do some accompaniment in a synthesizer
    with a similar voice and make a nice duo piece out of it.
