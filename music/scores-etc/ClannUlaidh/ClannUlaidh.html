    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Clann Ulaidh</i> on a tapping
    instrument such as the Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly
    DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature that will help you along the way.  
    These tabs fingerings are for a 12 string matched reciprocal tuning.
    <blockquote>
    Note: This could probabaly be adapted to 10 string MR or classic
    without a lot of effort.
    Contact me at <tt>mike.hoegeman@gmail.com</tt> if you'd like those tunings.
    I can probabaly make a version for you without too much effort.

<h3>Background</h3>
    <ul>
	<li>
	This song is by the prolific songwriter <i>Traditional</i>.
	As a result, there are many versions and it goes by other
	names as well.

        <li>
        There is <a href='https://youtu.be/w59xqu7wxlY'>
            an excellent instrumental version </a>
        of this song by the piper 
        <a href='https://www.brichaimbeul.com/'>
        Brigdhe Chaimbeul</a>
        which this arrangement is loosely modeled on.


    </ul>

<h3>Musescore score + tabs</h3>
    <p>
    This is the <a href=
      'https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/27560737'
    >Authoritative version</a>
    which is for <a href="../shared/12_string_MR.jpg">
        twelve string Matched reciprocal tuning</a>.
    <p>
    There may be others in the future with different tunings.

<h3>Elemental Structure</h3>
    <p>
    The tune is a lullaby (waltz) from the Gaelic speaking Hebridean
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barra'>
    island of Barra.
    </a>

    <p>
    The keys of this song have been various. This version is in D major
    or more specifically it's mode of A mixolydian, since the tonal center
    is around the note A in the song.

    <blockquote>
    Note: Brighde's version is in a different key than this version
    (up a third ?)
    </blockquote>

<h3>Playing tips</h3>
    If you have a "freeze" effects box / plugin or a looper, making a drone
    of a low A or, an A or A5 chord to play over can be used to good effect.
