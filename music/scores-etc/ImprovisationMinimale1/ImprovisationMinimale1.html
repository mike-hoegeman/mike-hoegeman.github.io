<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Improvisation Minimale
    no.1</i> on a tapping Instrument such as the <a
    href='https://stick.com/'>Chapman Stick</a> or the acoustic <a
    href='https://www.facebook.com/Dragonflytap'</a>Dragonfly DFA</a>
    .

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and youtube
    video instructions, that will help you along the way.  This
    song lives in a range that is adaptable to other tapping
    instrument tunings.

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. You can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the tabs and fingering hints for the song <a href='#scores'>(here)</a>


    Videos to go along with this piece are at this youtube

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    This original version of this song is by the Jazz Guitarist <a
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt
    >Django Reinhardt</a>
    And is the first song in a collection <i>Improvisations</i>.

<h2>Musescore score + tabs</h2>
    <p>
    The Score (and tabs) are available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691'>Here</a>
    Look for the ones with names that start with the <i>ImprovisationMinimale1</i>. 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/23081221'>
    The authoritative one which is for 12 string Matched reciprocal tuning</a>

<h2>Arrangement Notes</h2>
    <p>
    The first thing to mention is that this is a simplified rendition
    that is not quite as 'guitaristic' as the original work. So if
    you are after something trying to keep close to the original
    you should probably look elsewhere.

    <p>
    That said, play the associated
    musescore for it, and see if it's something for you. Then
    look further if you think it is.

    <p>
    This arrangement is notated with the <tt> C major </tt> key
    signature but that won't mean a lot because there's lot's of
    accidentals in the piece. In addition the piece is rubato
    throughout. I play it in the 80 pbm ballpark. 


    <p>Personally, I would recommend staying in the slower end of this tempo.
    a bpm of 120 is about as fast as i normally go on this piece.

    try at converting it.
