    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning 
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye_Pork_Pie_Hat'>
        <i>Goodby Pork Pie Hat</i> 
    </a>
    on a tapping instrument such as the Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly
    DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature that will help you along the way.  
    These tabs/fingerings are for a 12 string matched reciprocal tuning.

    <blockquote>
    Note: This could probably be adapted to 10 string MR or classic
    without a lot of effort.
    Contact me at <tt>mike.hoegeman@gmail.com</tt> if you'd like those tunings.
    I can probably make a version for you without too much effort.

    This transcription referred to one done by <a
    href='https://eanderez.wixsite.com/eduanderezclases/en'> Edu
    Anderez </a> for solo guitar. I would request that you make a
    donation to his website if you find this score useful <a
    href='https://eanderez.wixsite.com/eduanderezclases/en/ralphtowner'>
    here </a>.  This will allow you to also download the entire
    high quality transcription of the Anthem album for (solo) guitar
    for about 6$ which is of very high quality.

<h3>Background</h3>
    <ul>
	<li>
	This song is by <a
	href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus'>Charles Mingus
	</a> and is well seated within the pantheon of great jazz tunes.

        <li>
	This version is an arrangement by <a
	href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Towner'>Ralph
	Towner</a> for solo 12 string guitar. Ralph has recorded
	several different versions of this song. This arrangement
	is found on his album <i>Anthem</i> and is his shortest and most
	unusual one.

        <li>
        A <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/323zgh8pHYWmTaTbPCL5FW'>
        spotify link 
        </a>
        to hear what the arrangement sounds like in the original.

    </ul>

<h3>Elemental Structure</h3>
    <p>
    There is a atmospheric A and C prologue/epilogue sections, 
    with once through of the basic refrain as section B in the middle.
    This makes for a short approx 2 minute piece.

    <p>
    It's very different harmonic take on the song, as opposed to
    the blues based way the song takes normally. You make not even
    recognize it at first, it has a very impressionistic feel
    harmonically. It's very much in Towner's personal sensibility of
    arragements and original compositions.

<h3>Section A</h3>
    <p>
    This section is repetition of a 1-bar "finger-sticking" style
    phrase with open space at the end of the bar for variations. 

    <p>
    The lick is harmonically a <tt>Emin7+sus4</tt> chord

    interleaved like so:
    <blockquote>
    &darr; = bass side &uarr; = melody side
    <br><br>

    ( &darr; E3 &uarr; E5 &darr; A3 &uarr; G4 &uarr; B4 &uarr; D4 )

    </blockquote>

    between the melody and bass sides
    in such a way that emphasise the suspended note nicely
    with the root E and A present as bass notes.
