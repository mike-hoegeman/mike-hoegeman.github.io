<h1>Birdsong</h1>
<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Birdsong</i> on a tapping
    instrument such as the Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly
    DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and youtube
    video instructions, that will help you along the way.
    This song lives in a range that should be easily adapted to other tapping instrument tunings.

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. In fact, you can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the Fretboard diagrams, and playing the song on <a
        href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/20919499'
    >the Musecore web page.</a>

<h2>Background</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>
	This song is by the famous jazz drummer <a
	href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Motian'>Paul
	Motian</a>. Who has written a lot of great songs. Many ,
	like this one, are small jewels of musicality.

        <li>
	This song is in the mode Ab Lydian, (the 4th mode of the
	<tt>Eb</tt> Major scale) which Mr. Motian had an affinity for.  you
	can also think of Ab lydian as the Ab Major scale with the
	<tt>D</tt> fourth raised a half step

        To my
	mind, this particular song has a lot of similarities to
	Erik Satie's <a
		href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnop%C3%A9dies'>
		<i>Gymnopédies</i> </a>

	with it's slow dreamy 3/4 rythmn and impressionistic melody
	<br>

<h2>Elemental Structure</h2>
<hr>
    <p>
    As mentioned before, this piece is very much like one of Satie's
    <i>Gymnopédies</i>. It's in a slow 3/4 time signture where The bass
    side is a sequence of <tt>Ab</tt> pedal notes held through each bar
    with a second note overlaid on top of it on the second beat of the
    bar.

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <a href='https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet/key/a-flat/lydian'>
    This page
    </a>
    explains Ab Lydian a little bit and can be useful when you are
    thinking of ways to improvise within the song
