<h1>Birdsong</h1>

<img src=banner.png></img>
<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Birdsong</i> on a tapping
    instrument such as the Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly
    DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and youtube
    video instructions, that will help you along the way.
    This song lives in a range that should be easily adapted to other tapping instrument tunings.

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. In fact, you can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the Fretboard diagrams, and playing the song on <a
        href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/20919499'
    >the Musecore web page.</a>

<h2>Background</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>
	This song is by the famous jazz drummer <a
	href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Motian'>Paul
	Motian</a>. Who has written a lot of great songs. Many ,
	like this one, are small jewels of musicality.

        <li>
	This song is in the mode Ab Lydian, (the 4th mode of the
	<tt>Eb</tt> Major scale) which Mr. Motian had an affinity for.  you
	can also think of Ab lydian as the Ab Major scale with the
	<tt>D</tt> fourth raised a half step

        To my
	mind, this particular song has a lot of similarities to
	Erik Satie's <a
		href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnop%C3%A9dies'>
		<i>Gymnopédies</i> </a>

	with it's slow dreamy 3/4 rythmn and impressionistic melody
	<br>

<h2>Elemental Structure</h2>
<hr>
    <p>
    As mentioned before, this piece is very much like one of Satie's
    <i>Gymnopédies</i>. It's in a slow 3/4 time signture where The bass
    side is a sequence of <tt>Ab</tt> pedal notes held through each bar
    with a second note overlaid on top of it on the second beat of the
    bar.

    <p> Each section of the piece is typically played twice, so the
    basic song structure is ike this:

    <blockquote>
    <code>
    A A B B C C
    </code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    After which the whole piece then repeats a number of times and optionally
    improvised on ( to taste ).

    <p>
    <a href='https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet/key/a-flat/lydian'>
    This page
    </a>
    explains Ab Lydian a little bit and can be useful when you are
    thinking of ways to improvise within the song.  I also suggest
    you listen to Jason Moran and Chris Potter playing this song
    on the <i>Lost In a Dream album</i> I mentioned above.

<blockquote>
    Note: 
    <ul>
    <li>Each of these diagrams is in
    <a target="popup"
    href="../shared/12_string_MR.jpg">12 string matched reciprocal
    tuning.</a> It will have link to a <code>.fbjson</code> file that
    you can download and then use in conjunction with
    <a  target="popup"
        href="https://mike-hoegeman.github.io/fretboard_diagrammer/fretboard.html">
        Fretboard diagammer web app</a>

    <li>You can read the file into it and change the tuning in the
    tuning configuration drop down and it will make a (simple minded)
    try at converting it.

    <li>You can click on any diagram to get an enlarged version.

<h3>Heat Map</h3>
<p>
This is the general area where you will be to be playing.

<p><b>Exercise:</b><br>
On the bass side, You can also play the song's three dyads (<i>two
note chords</i>) in the descending sequence: <br>
<blockquote>
    <tt> Ab+G(7th), Ab+F(6th), Ab+Eb(5th) </tt> 
</blockquote>
<p>
as pedals in 3/4 time. 

<p>Notice that the upper notes descend downward in intervals
<tt>7th, 6th, 5th</tt> with respect to constant root <tt>Ab</tt>.

<blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li>
    tap and hold the first note of the dyad on the first beat
    <li>
    tap and hold the second note of the dyad on the second beat
    <li>
    hold both notes through the third beat
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>On the melody side, you can play the Ab Lydian (Eb Major) scale
in the melody area in a 3/4 time signature to get your fingers used
to playing there.
