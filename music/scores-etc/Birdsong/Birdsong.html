<h1>Birdsong</h1>
<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Birdsong</i> on a tapping
    instrument such as the Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly
    DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and youtube
    video instructions, that will help you along the way.
    This song lives in a range that should be easily adapted to other tapping instrument tunings.

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. In fact, you can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the Fretboard diagrams, and playing the song on <a

<h2>A bit of background about the piece</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>
	This song is by the famous jazz drummer <a
	href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Motian'>Paul
	Motian</a>. Who has written a lot of great songs. Many ,
	like this one, are small jewels of musicality.

        <li>
        This song is in Ab Major, a key which Mr. Motian had an affinity for.
        To my mind, this particular song has a lot of similarities to Erik Satie's 
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnop%C3%A9dies'>
                <i>Gymnopédies</i>
                </a>
	with it's slow dreamy 3/4 rythmn and impressionistic melody

<h2>Elemental Structure of the Piece</h2>
As mentioned before, this piece is very much like one of Satie's
<i>Gymnopédies</i>. It's in a slow 3/4 time signture where The bass
side is a sequence of <tt>Ab</tt> pedal notes held through each bar
with a second note overlaid on top of it on the second beat of the
bar.
