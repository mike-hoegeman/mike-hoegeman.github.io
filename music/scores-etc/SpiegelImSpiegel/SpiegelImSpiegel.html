<h1>Spiegel Im Spiegel</h1>
<hr>
    This page is a guide to learning Arvo Part's wonderful composition
    <i>Spiegel im Spiegel</i> on a tapping instrument such as the
    Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and 
    (to be done) youtube video instructions, that will help you along the
    way. 

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. In fact, you can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the Fretboard diagrams. It will be a bit of work, but it can
    be learned incrementally and, as you'll see, even playing part
    of the piece is very fun and sounds great.

<h2>A bit of background about the piece</h2>

            Wikipedia Entry</a></li>

        <li>Take a listen to a few versions of this piece.  <a
        href='https://youtu.be/EHe2Sa_lLUo?si=ZN3uy0v1AVG7Bw2X'>This version</a>
        by the classical guitarist Derek Gripper is one of my favorites. </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Musescore score with tabs</h2>
    <p>
    The Score (and tabs) to go along with the diagrams below is available

<h2>Elemental Structure of the Piece</h2>
    <p>
    The piece is composed entirely from XXX very short phrases that
    are a pair of 3 quarter note 'arpeggios'.
    The piece has a time signature of 6/4 so each phrase is a single
    measure. I'll call these '<i>phreasures</i>' 
    <p>
    There is a bass voice that runs along with this constant flow
    of phreasures. The voice is simply a pair of notes played
    at the first and fourth note of each phreasure.

    <i>example:</i>
    <p>
    <img src='Spiegel-Phrase-Example.png'></img>
    <br>These phreasures are used to build series of 16
    <i>sequences</i>. 

    <p>
    Each sequence introduces one or two new phreasures as the piece
    progresses. I would suggest just learning phreasures as you
    learn each new sequence.

    The Fretboard diagrams below map out the general fingering
    information for each phreasure used in the piece.

<h5>Phreasure Naming</h5>
    Each phreasure has a two letter name that corresponds to the first
    note of the phreasure along with the octave number of that note.
    The phreasures diagrams below are in the order that they first appear in

    the piece. For example, phreasure <b>C4</b> starts
    at Middle C. This works well because there is only one phreasure
    that's starts on any particular note in the piece. Phreasures like
    <b>F2</b> and <b>F3</b> that have the same note name have the
    same shape, just in a different location on the fretboard.

    <p><blockquote>
    I realize my explanations of the piece are sounding complicated
    at this point. Fear not! Once you progess through a few diagrams,
    along with the <a href=''>Instruction Video</a>, you'll quickly
    understand how the piece is structured</blockquote>
