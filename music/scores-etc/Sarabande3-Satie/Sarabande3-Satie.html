<h1>Sarabande 3</h1>

<img src=banner.jpeg width=350></img>
<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Sarabande 3</i> on a tapping
    Instrument such as the 
    <a href='https://stick.com/'>Chapman Stick</a> or the acoustic 
    <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Dragonflytap'</a>Dragonfly DFA</a>
    .

<!--
    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and youtube
    video instructions, that will help you along the way.
    This song lives in a range that should be easily adapted to other tapping instrument tunings.
-->

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. In fact, you can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the Fretboard diagrams, and playing the song on <a

    >the Musecore web page.</a>

    > This is the authoritative one</a>
    which is for twelve string Matched reciprocal tuning

<hr>
    There are a lot of enharmonic notes in this song. Don't let
    that freak you out

<h2>Fretboard Diagrams and Instruction Videos</h2>
<hr>
<blockquote>
    Note: 
    <ul>
    <li>Each of these diagrams is in
    <a target="popup"
    href="../shared/12_string_MR.jpg">12 string matched reciprocal
    tuning.</a> It will have link to a <code>.fbjson</code> file that
    you can download and then use in conjunction with the
    <a  target="popup"
        href="https://mike-hoegeman.github.io/fretboard_diagrammer/fretboard.html">
        Fretboard diagammer web app</a>

    <li>You can read the file into it and change the tuning in the
    tuning configuration drop down and it will make a (simple minded)
    try at converting it.

    <li>You can click on any diagram to get an enlarged version.

<h2>Elemental Structure</h2>
    <p>
    This song is in <tt>Bb</tt> minor, (<tt>Db</tt> Major scale).
    and , like all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarabande">Sarabande's</a>, it is in a <tt>3/4</tt>
    time with a slow tempo. <tt>50-60 bpm</tt> works well at first. One can
    speed up it up once you get feel for how you want to play it.

    <p>
    Most of the barioque dance suites, which included a sarabande,
    followed a what is called a <i>binary form</i> which is comprised
    of two sections, <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> , that are usually played twice giving
    you:

<blockquote>
        A A B B
</blockquote>

    <p>
    Sarabande no. 3 loosely hints at this format, but the general
    feel of the piece is so ephemeral, it's not very recognizable.

    <p>
    The note names and chords in Bb minor are
<code>
    i   Bb Tonic            Bbmin           Bb - Db - F
    ii* C  supertonic       Cdim            C - Eb - Gb
    III Db mediant          DbMaj           Db - F - Ab
    iv  Eb subdominant      Ebmin           Eb - Gb - Bb
    v   F  dominant         Fmin            F - Ab - C
    VI  Gb submediant       GbMaj           Gb - Bb - Db
    VII Ab leading note     AbMaj           Ab - C - Eb
</code>

    <p>
    Of course, this is Satie, so this piece is far afield of the 
    sarabandes of old harmonically.

    <p>
    It has a pretty big range, so if you are using a different
    tuning than 12 str matched reciprocal. you will have to do a
    small bit of arranging in a few places. I have already done a
    bit of arranging of this piece to get it to fit into
    range of typical tapping instruments <i>(nothing major though, mostly just one 4 bar section dropped down an octave) </i>
