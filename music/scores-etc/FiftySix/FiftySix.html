<h1>FiftySix</h1>
<hr>
    This page is a guide to learning 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Farka_Tour%C3%A9">Ali Farke Toure</a>'s song
    <i>FiftySix</i> on a tapping instrument such as the
    Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and 
    (to be done) youtube video instructions, that will help you along the
    way. 

<h2>A bit of background about the piece</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegel_im_Spiegel'>
            Wikipedia Entry</a></li>

        <li>Take a listen to a few versions of this piece.  <a
        href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_and_Toumani'>This version</a>
        is by Ali Farke and the Kora player Toumani Diabate</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Musescore score with tabs</h2>
    <p>
    The Score (and tabs) to go along with the diagrams below is available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/10800778'>Here</a>
    even if you can't read music well (or at all), Bringing up the 
    score is </b>very useful</b>. <b>I can't emphasize this enough</b>... why?
    <ul>
    <li>you can play/loop a range of measures (phrase) in the score </li>
    <li>view the diagram associated with those measures </li>
    <li>play along with the loop until you've got the phrase down</li>
    </ul>

    Even if you don't use the same tuning as the one the score/diagrams.
    the shapes in the diagram will generally be the same. so you
    can go a long way with those resources even with a different
    tuning


<h2>Some tips</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The piece is in Bb Major (G minor) thoughout.
    </li>
    <li>
	Really Learn the bass "loop phrase" until you you can
	play it without thinking about it (it's just three notes)
	You can also just put this phrase in a looper as it runs
	thoughout the entire piece after the Intro Section.
    </li>

<h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
    Traditionally, the intro is improvised. In the score however,
    I have written out an intro section that you can use as a
    starting point. I've also diagrammed the bass chords I tend to use
    when improvising the intro section as some hints for you.

    <p>
    These are used in the written out intro. You'll want to get
    confortable moving between them. In the written intro they typically
    arpeggiate upwards.

    <h6>Intro: Phrase resolution chord.svg </h6>
    I trend to use this one at the end of a phrase in the Into/Iprov section
    when i want to resolve/emphasize back to base Key (Bb) of the song

    <h6>Intro: Bars 1-2</h6>

    Bring up the <a target="popup" href="https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/10800778" >score</a> and use the [loop] button
    to the start bar at measure and end at measure 2. then use the
    play button to loop those two bars. Use this procedure for each
    diagram as you go..
