<h4>Musescore score with tabs</h4>
    <p> The Score (and tabs) to go along with the diagrams below is available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/25902565'>here</a>.
    The musescore/tabs tuning is 12 string matched reciprocal. It
    should be easily adaptable to most 12 string free hands tunings.
    <p>
    On a 10 string instrument, you are likely to be missing a needed
    low or high string on the melody so some adjustments will have to be made.

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>
This is a piece that should be treated as a single voice. So
set your EQ, levels, and other processing accordingly.

<p>
There are 26 (effectively) 16th-note repeated arpeggio patterns in
this piece. Most of them are pretty simple and grouped into 3/4/8
bar segments. Usually, the first one or two notes of each arpeggio
are on the bass side before going to the melody side for the rest
of the arpeggio.  

<blockquote>Concentrate on getting a smooth flow between the leading bass note(s) and the melody notes</blockquote>

<p>
It will take a decent amount of practice to execute this piece.
The rigor is in stringing them all together in a smooth
flow throughout the entire piece.
<p>
There are directions in the score that will give hints on how to flucuate the
dynamics of the piece. I have a few tempo controls in the score , but you should use your own discretion on those. Finding guidance in the reference recordings and then doing your own thing is probably the best way to go. The tempo is generally around 80-85 bpm but it should vary freely around that.
