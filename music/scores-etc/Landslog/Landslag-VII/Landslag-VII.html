<h4>Musescore score with tabs</h4>
    <p> The Score (and tabs) to go along with the diagrams below is available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/25902565'>here</a>.
    The musescore/tabs tuning is 12 string matched reciprocal. It
    should be easily adaptable to most 12 string free hands tunings.
    <p>
    On a 10 string instrument, you are likely to be missing a needed
    low or high string on the melody so some adjustments will have to be made.

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>
This is a piece that should be treated as a single voice. So
set your EQ, levels, and other processing accordingly.

<p>
There are &asymp;26 16th-note repeated arpeggio patterns in
this piece grouped into 3,4, and 8 bar segments.  The first one or
two notes of each arpeggio are usually on the bass side before going
to the melody side for the rest of the arpeggio. When that's not
the case, it's likely because there's a bass/melody interleaving
(<i>fingersticking</i>) approach that makes for a better flow of
the arpeggio. This may look more complicated at first, but the
intent is that once you get used to interleaving, pattern , you
will find it easier to do the arpeggio as a smoother sustained
sequence.

<p>
Given all that, it's a bit more difficult to master this on a tapping instrument than guitar, but's it's still very doable. Patient persistance will pay off with a great sounding piece.

<blockquote>
Concentrate on getting a smooth flow between the leading bass note(s) and the melody notes.  It will take a decent amount of practice to execute this piece.
The rigor is in stringing them all together in a smooth
flow throughout.
</blockquote>

There are directions in the score that will give hints on how to
fluctuate the dynamics of the piece. I have a few tempo controls
in the score , but you should use your own discretion on those.
Finding guidance in the reference recordings and then doing your
own thing is probably the best way to go. The tempo is generally
around 80-85 bpm but it should vary freely around that.
