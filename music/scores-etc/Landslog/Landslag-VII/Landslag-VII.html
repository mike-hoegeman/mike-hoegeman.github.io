<h4>Musescore score with tabs</h4>
    <p> The Score (and tabs) to go along with the diagrams below is available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/25902565'>here</a>.
    The musescore/tabs tuning is 12 string matched reciprocal. It
    should be easily adaptable to any 12 string free hands tuning.
    With a 10 string there are 2 or three measures that would need
    a little extra tweaking.

<h4>Notes:</h4>
There are 26 (effectively) 16th-note repeated arpeggio patterns in
this piece. Most of them are pretty simple and grouped into 3/4/8
bar segments. typically the first one or two notes of each arpeggio
is on the bass side before going to the melody side for the rest
of the arpeggio.

<p>
There are a few that are (very) slightly more difficult. 
<p>
The tempo is generally around 75 bpm but it varies freely around that.
