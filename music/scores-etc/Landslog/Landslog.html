    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning  (some of) Gulli Björnsson's
    suite of solo guitar pieces <i>Landslög</i> on a tapping
    instrument such as the Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly
    DFA.  There is a score/tablature & fretboard diagrams, to help you
    along the way.

    <p>
    There's a <a href='https://youtu.be/J8SPDieQpBo?si=2p98i7OXaLxO_E-v'>
    performance by Gulli of the suite</a> that will give you some
    good guidance on how to approach playing it.

    <p>
    In addition, You can get a free 
    <a href='https://resources.tonebase.co/guitar/free-classical-guitar-sheet-music/bjornsson-landslog'>
    PDF of the score for the suite</a> for solo guitar from Tonebase,
    that also has some very useful commentary by the composer.
    <p>
    His <a href='https://gullibjornsson.bandcamp.com/album/landsl-g'>album of the suite</a> can be found on bandcamp.


<h2>A few words about the suite by the composer</h2>

<blockquote>
    Landslög (landscapes) is a set of 11 pieces for solo guitar drawing
    inspiration from Icelandic landscapes. The pieces aren’t really
    connected in any way, one advantage of that is that each one can
    stand on it’s own as a piece of music and the landscapes can also
    be played together in any fashion… [I] finally got around to recording
    it on an album! I did so in my parents cabin in Iceland in the dead
    of winter. So if you hear a crackle here and there in the recordings
    that’s the fire in the cabin keeping me from freezing.
