    This page is a guide to learning <i>Red Rocking Chair</i> on a tapping
    instrument such as the Chapman Stick or the acoustic Dragonfly
    DFA.

    <p>There is a score/tablature that will help you along the way.  
    These tabs fingerings are for a 12 string matched reciprocal tuning.

    This song lives in a range however, that should be adaptable
    to other tapping instrument tunings.

<h3>Background</h3>
    <ul>
	<li>
	This song is by the prolific songwriter <i>Traditional</i>.
	As a result, there are many versions and it goes by other
	names as well. It was made popular in recent times by an
	adaptation by Doc Watson on his 1981 <a
	href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rocking_Chair'>album of
	the same name</a>

        <li>
	The one this transcription is loosely based on is by the
	pickup trio of Tim O'Brien, Bill Frisell, & Dale Bruning
	on their album <a href='https://youtu.be/K-aFqM0y6oY'>Life
	Lessons</a> which is was recorded (live?) at eTown Hall in
	Boulder Co.  This version to me is a lot more interesting
	in it's move away from bluegrass to a slower tempo and
	folk-jazz-blues undercurrent that's more reminiscent of the
	song's Scottish Ballad origins. The lyrics are also more
	ambiguous which lends it a mysterious air.

        <li>
	Here's <a href='https://youtu.be/EQJo4PcJbfo'>another
	version</a> that's in the earlier original ballad style
	that is more similar to the transcription than other
	bluegrassy versions.

    </ul>

    <p>
    There may be others in the future with different tunings.

<h3>Elemental Structure</h3>
<hr>
    <p>
    The keys of this song have been various. This version is modal,
    in particular <a href="">D Dorian</a> which contributes in a
    significant way to it's aforementioned folk-jazz-blues feel.
