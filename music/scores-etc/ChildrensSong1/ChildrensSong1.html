<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Childrens Song no. 1</i> on a tapping
    Instrument such as the 
    <a href='https://stick.com/'>Chapman Stick</a> or the acoustic 
    <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Dragonflytap'</a>Dragonfly DFA</a>
    .

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and youtube
    video instructions, that will help you along the way.  This
    song lives in a range that is adaptable to other tapping
    instrument tunings.

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. In fact, you can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the tabs and fingering hints for the song on <a
        href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/'
    >the Musecore web page.</a>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    This song is by the venerable Jazz and Fusion Pianist <a
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Corea
    >Chick Corea</a>
    And is the first song in the collection <a 
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Songs_(Chick_Corea_album)
        >Childrens Songs</a> 
    which were loosely modeled after Balo Bartoks's cycle of songs called 
    <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikrokosmos_(Bart%C3%B3k)"
    >Mikrokosmos</a>

<h2>Musescore score + tabs</h2>
    <p>
    The Score (and tabs) to go along with the diagrams below is available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691'>Here</a>
    Look for the ones with names that start with the <i>ChildrensSong1</i>. 
    <a 
        href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/22119715'
    > This is the authoritative one</a>
    which is for twelve string Matched reciprocal tuning
    <p>
    There is also one for 10 string Classic tuning. 
    Between these two you should be able to adapt a version to other tunings
    if you are industrious. The song is not overly complex.

<h2>Elemental Structure</h2>
    <p>
    This song is in <tt>D</tt> major.

        <a href='../shared/DMajorCMap.fbjson'>
        <code>.fbjson file</code></a>


<h2>Arrangement Notes</h2>

    <p>
    I have slightly changed the bass motor in the song by droppping
    one of the notes down an octve. This serves two purpose. It
    makes it much easier to play on the 5ths bass side tuning, and
    it opens up the sound of the pattern a bit which i prefer.

    <p>
    I have added a D.S. repeat of a section of the song which i
    like doing sometimes. you can ignore that of course if you choose.
