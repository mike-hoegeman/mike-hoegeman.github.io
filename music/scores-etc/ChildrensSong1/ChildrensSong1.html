<h1>Childrens Song no. 1</h1>

<img src=banner.jpeg ></img>
<hr>
    <p>
    This page is a guide to learning <i>Childrens Song no. 1</i> on a tapping
    Instrument such as the 
    <a href='https://stick.com/'>Chapman Stick</a> or the acoustic 
    <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Dragonflytap'</a>Dragonfly DFA</a>
    .

    <p>There is a score/tablature, fretboard diagrams, and youtube
    video instructions, that will help you along the way.  This
    song lives in a range that is adaptable to other tapping
    instrument tunings.

    <p> You don't need to know how to read music. You can
    get 90% of the way there just by watching the videos and referring
    to the tabs and fingering hints for the song on <a
        href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/'
    >the Musecore web page.</a>


    The videos (TBD) to go along with this piece are at this youtube

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    This song is by the venerable Jazz and Fusion Pianist <a
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Corea
    >Chick Corea</a>
    And is the first song in the collection <a 
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Songs_(Chick_Corea_album)
        >Childrens Songs</a> 
    which were loosely modeled after Bela Bartoks's cycle of songs called 
    <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikrokosmos_(Bart%C3%B3k)"
    >Mikrokosmos</a>

<h2>Musescore score + tabs</h2>
    <p>
    The Score (and tabs) are available 
    <a href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691'>Here</a>
    Look for the ones with names that start with the <i>ChildrensSong1</i>. 
    <a 
        href='https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/22119715'
    > This is the authoritative one</a>
    which is for twelve string Matched reciprocal tuning
    <p>
    There is also one for 
    <a href=https://musescore.com/user/30359691/scores/23085256>
    10 string Classic tuning. 
    </a>

    <p>
    <small><i>Between these two you should be able to adapt a version to other
    tunings if you are industrious. The song is not overly complex.
    </i></small>


<h2>Elemental Structure</h2>
    <p> This arrangement is in <tt>D</tt> major (instead of the
    original <tt>C</tt> major).  Which is typical in guitar
    transcriptions.  There is use of the accidentals <tt>G#</tt>
    and <tt>C</tt> which give the song an ethereal feel reminisent
    of Erik Satie.

    <p>The tempo is designated as <i>Allegretto</i>, which is
    something to pay attention to. I've listened to some versions
    with faster tempo's and they tend rob the song of some of that
    Satie saveur.

    <p>I would recommend staying in the slower end of this tempo.
    The musescore file is set at bpm=116 which is just about as fast as i 
    normally go on this piece.

    <p>
    There is two bar Bass Motor that is continuous throughout.

<h2>Arrangement Notes</h2>

    <p>
    I have slightly changed the bass motor in the song by dropping
    the last note note down an octave. This serves two purpose. It
    makes it much easier to play on the 5ths bass side tuning, and
    it opens up the sound of the pattern a bit which i prefer.

    <p>
    I have added a D.S. repeat of a section of the song which i
    like doing. you can ignore that of course if you choose.
