<h2>Design for a music bench</h2>

<img src=banner.jpg ></img>

<p>
I currently play music on my Chapman stick and Dragonfly acoustic
stringed instruments while seated on a quicklok keyboard/piano
bench, similar in the way a cellist usually plays. It does this
function well, but there are other issues that make it an annoying
tool for making music.

<p>
This has led me to try and come up with something better.

<p>
<h5>My typical music work flow at home
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
    Tune my instrument, pull up some sheet music on the computer,
    and play for a while.
<li>
    Park the instrument on it's stand next to me, work
    on the compter ( e.g. on some sheet music notation ) for 20
    minutes or so, perhaps get a coffee, play some more.
<li>
    Repeat the above some number of times.
</ul>


<h5>My piano bench is lousy for this work flow</h5>
<p>
When I am doing this music work, I switch my seating between two
specific heights.  <b>Playing height (24 in).</b> and <b>Desk work
height (16 in.)</b>

<blockquote> <small>
I have the seat height at 24" on the piano bench which is most
comfortable for me for this activity.  Doing desk work for me is
uncomfortable with a seat height of 24 in. I like to sit lower than
that, like around 16 in. I could raise the desk, but that's still
not comfortable for me. So... I have to switch seats and use my
Aeron desk chair. Not Ideal.</small></blockquote>

<p>
I also want to move the bench quickly and easily when I want to use
my Aeron desk chair instead for other activities.

<p>
The piano bench is a tank and it's awkward to move even just a
few feet. So switching seating is awkward. It's also slow and
awkward to change it's height. I could use a drum stool or something
similar, but even that is really too much fiddling for my liking.

<h5>The basic basic requirements for something else</h5>
<ul>
<li>
    Relatively light (<i>e.g. pick it up with one hand and move it 
    6 ft or so.</i>)
<li>
    Easy to switch to two different, specific, heights with close to zero fuss
<li>
    Reasonably accomodate my 6ft 1in, 225 lb. dad bod.
</ul>

<h5>Max Bill's Ulm Stool Design</h5>
    <p>
    The possible answer to my search for something better came quite by 
    accident.

    <p>
    I was looking at some bauhaus designer museum exhibits online
    and i came across a very interesting piece of furniture by the
    famous designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bill">Max
    Bill</a> The Ulmer stool, which he designed in 1954. 
    <p>

    <img width=425 src=https://www.eguide.ch/wp-content/uploads/2093/1511_5.8c_ulm2123_foto_c.jpg>

    You'll notice that in the picture with the students using it
    for seating, they are using it in <i>two different orientations</i>,
    which have two different heights. Eureka ! :)

    <p>
    If browse through an image search of google with 
    <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=%27ulm%27+stool&sca_esv=59a6e62f1102fd89&udm=2&biw=1649&bih=1150&sxsrf=AHTn8zqJ5_EOC5vu3brOLrvcjDSMdi374Q%3A1738033399769&ei=90iYZ6TVLtHekPIPqYTC0AY&ved=0ahUKEwjkrJr7tpeLAxVRL0QIHSmCEGoQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=%27ulm%27+stool&gs_lp=EgNpbWciCyd1bG0nIHN0b29sMgQQABgeMgQQABgeMgQQABgeMgQQABgeSIxFUNsKWJ1BcAF4AJABAJgBNqABigOqAQE4uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIEoAKfAcICBBAjGCeYAwCIBgGSBwE0oAe1Bw&sclient=img'><tt><b>'ulm' stool</b></tt></a> 
    , you'll see it's used in a myraid of ways as a modular piece
    of furniture, including a carrier/basket of sorts by turning
    the stool upside down and using the crossbar dowel of the stool
    as the handle of the basket.

<h5>Tailoring the Ulm Stool</h5>
    <p>
    The original Ulm stool has height/width/depth dimensions of:
    <blockquote>
    44cm / 39.5cm / 29.5cm  or 17in / 15.5in / 11.25in
    </blockquote>

    If alter the dimensions close to: 
    <blockquote>
        24in / 16in / 16in
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    I'll fulfill my basic requirements for my music bench. I can switch from
    24in high to 16in hight by just tipping the stool over on it's
    side and back again as needed for playing or "desking".

    <p>
    As I pondered further, I discovered that <i>finewoodworking.com</i> 
    <a href='https://www.finewoodworking.com/project-guides/beginner-projects/transforming-table-will-transform-your-skills'>
    already had the same idea </a> , although not specifically as
    a music bench. Here's what their version looks like.
