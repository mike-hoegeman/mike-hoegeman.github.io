<h4 align=center>Acknowledgement</h4>

<p>
I had been constantly dissatisfied with the knowledge of harmony 
of my students of composition at the University of
California, Los Angeles. To remedy this shortcoming I
instituted a new class to which the conventional harmony
teaching should be the prerequisite: STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONS
OF HARMONY. At this time (1939) a young former student
of mine, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Stein_(musicologist)'>
Leonard Stein</a>, had already become my assistant
and remained in this capacity for the next three· years.
Thus naturally when I started to write the present book I
could not select one better to help me express my ideas. He
had observed the development of these ideas from the very
beginning and had watched me struggling with their formulation.

<p>
I was not wrong in this selection. While perhaps a perfectionist 
might have tortured me with corrections of my English,
upsetting the flow of ideas, he had the patience to let me pro-
nounce my sentences in their rudest forms if only they expressed
the idea clearly. Of course the gravest grammatical errors had
to be eliminated, but the polishing of the style could be postponed.

<p>
In spite of the preliminary work done in classes and Mr.
Stein's collection of notes and examples at this time, the real
writing and frequent rewriting of the book demanded nearly
two years. The extreme number of examples necessary for
illustrating and clarifying every problemjthe application of
the theories in the analysis of the examples from literature and
the inevitable work of writing and copying are indications of
Mr. Stein's share in the production of this book.
I use with pleasure this opportunity to thank him for his
intelligent, careful, assiduous and discriminating assistance.
