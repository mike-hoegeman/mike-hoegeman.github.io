Vegan chickpeas - Indian butter chicken style sauce


Ingredients
4 Tbsp. unsalted plant butter -- unsalted not crucial
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
1 tsp. (or more) kosher salt, divided
1/2 cup tomato paste
1/2 serrano chile, seeded, *finely* chopped (can dial this down if desired)
1 Tbsp. grated grated ginger
2 (14.5-oz.) cans chickpeas, drained, rinsed
1/8 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. garam masala
1 tsp. ground cumin
3/4 tsp. japanese togarashi spice (or 3/4 tsp. paprika plus 1/4 tsp. cayenne)
1 can coconut cream (approx 14 oz. can)
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
Cooked jasmine rice or naan, for serving


-- Step 1
In a large, high-sided skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add
onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until
softened, about 7 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring
constantly, until darkened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add chile and ginger
and cook, stirring, until fragrant and tomato paste is starting to
stick to pan, about 1 minute more.

-- Step 2
Add chickpeas and baking soda and stir to combine, then add garam
masala, cumin, and togarashi and cook, stirring frequently, until
fragrant and incorporated, about 30 seconds.

-- Step 3
Stir in coconut cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 cup
water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat
to low and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce
is reduced, 10 to 15 minutes.  Step 4 Divide rice among bowls or
plates. Season chickpeas with salt, if needed, then top with cilantro.
Spoon chickpeas over rice.
