Carrot Gnocchi
--------------


Ingredients

    3 cups chopped carrots (about 3 whole carrots)
    3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
    1 egg
    2 cloves grated garlic, divided
    1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
    2 teaspoons salt, divided
    ½ cup walnuts

    8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, divided - plant butter will work.

    ½ cup grated Romano cheese
    ½ cup grated parmesan 
    ( nutritional yeast would likely work also in place of the cheese.)
    ( or even panko bread crumbs and a bit of salt )

Directions

    Add carrots to a saucepan and cover with water. Boil until
    fork-tender, about 20 minutes.

    Drain carrots, place into a large bowl, and mash into a paste
    using a potato masher.

    Add the flour, parmesan, egg, 1 clove grated garlic, thyme, and
    1 teaspoon salt to the carrots. Combine until a dough ball
    forms.

    Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead gently until
    firm and workable.

    Cut dough into 4 sections. Roll each section into 1-inch ropes.
    Slice each rope into 1/2-inch pieces.

    If desired, roll gnocchi on a rigagnocchi, creating grooves in
    the dumplings.

    To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pot of water to boil. Working
    in batches, cook gnocchi in boiling water until soft, about 1-2
    minutes.

    Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet. Add drained gnocchi
    and walnuts and cook until both are browned, about 4-5 minutes.

    Remove the gnocchi and walnuts from the skillet. Add the remaining
    7 tablespoons butter.  

    Cook butter over medium heat until browned, stirring often,
    about 5-10 minutes. 

    Add the remaining grated garlic and salt, and stir to combine.
    Pour browned butter over gnocchi.  To serve, top with grated
    Romano.
