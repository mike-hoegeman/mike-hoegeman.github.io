Srirachamole

    Asian seasoned guacamole born out of what was in my pantry one day.
    In the end, all ingredients are to taste.

Ingredients

    - 1 avocado
    - 5 cherry tomato's halfed or quartered
    - 5 medium-large green olives roughly cut up (optional)
    - 1 tsp. Nori Fume Furikake seasoning (Trader Joe's has this)
    - 3/4 tsp. Sriracha sauce (use Huy Fong if possible)
    - Dash of kosher salt
