This sheet pan gnocchi recipe is one of our favorite easy dinners!
Store-bought gnocchi roasts alongside fresh veggies and tangy feta
cheese. No boiling required! I usually get most of the ingredients at trader Joes'

* Equipment
    - Large baking sheet pan
    - Parchment Paper

* Ingredients
    - 1 pound store-bought potato gnocchi (we like Isola)
    - 1 bunch broccolini, ends trimmed, florets cut into big pieces and stems cut into ½-inch pieces
      (approx. 1/2 to 2/3 the amt. of the tomatoes)
    - 1 pint cherry tomatoes
    - ½ small red onion, thinly sliced
    - 2 or 3 garlic cloves, sliced
    - 2 or 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
    - ½ teaspoon sea salt
    - ½ teaspoon *fresh* thyme leaves
    - ½ teaspoon za’atar (important in my opinion)
    - ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (I use togadashi)
    - Freshly ground black pepper
    - 6 ounces feta cheese, torn into 3/4-inch chunks
    - Fresh parsley, for garnish, optional

* Instructions
    1. Preheat the oven to 450°F and line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

    2. In a large bowl, toss together the gnocchi, broccolini,
    cherry tomatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, salt, thyme, za’ atar, 
    red pepper flakes, and several grinds of pepper.  Spread
    evenly on the baking sheet.

    3. Roast for 10 minutes. Stir, then scatter the feta on top.
    Roast for 15 to 20 more minutes, or until the gnocchi is tender
    and the vegetables and feta are browned. Garnish with parsley,
    if desired.  Season to taste and serve.
