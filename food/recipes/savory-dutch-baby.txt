Savory Dutch Baby

7 tablespoons Unsalted Butter Quarters, divided (plant butter works fine)
1 Yellow Onion, thinly sliced
3 Fresh Thyme (dried is ok also)
1 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
A few cranks of TJ’s Black Peppercorns ( or togarashi )
1/2 cup Whole Milk
3 Eggs
1/2 cup All-Purpose Flour
1/2 cup grated Le Gruyère 
  ( i use trader joes' shredded gruyere/swiss sometimes for less prep )
1 package Prosciutto ( or use sauted spinach and mushrooms or whatever )



Directions:

** Prepare the veggies: Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large sauté
pan (or use your cast iron pan to be used for the pancake) over
medium-high heat. and thyme, cover with lid, and cook for 10-15
minute, stirring occasionally, until the onions become golden in
color. Remove from heat, discard thyme and season with 1/2 teaspoon
of salt and pepper. Set aside. 

If you are using other veggies add them sometime during the process
with the onions don't go too overboard with the amount of veggies

If you were using the cast iron pan to prep the veggies. rinse/wipe
it clean of residue.

** Prepare the Dutch Baby Pancake: Place 10 or 12-inch  ( i use 12) 
cast iron pan in cold oven, then heat your oven to 425° F. Combine
milk, eggs, 1 teaspoon of salt, and flour in blender/food processor
and blend on high speed until the mixture is smooth. Carefully
remove the hot cast iron pan and place on a flat, heat resistant
surface. Add remaining 4 tablespoons of butter to pan and swirl
around the bottom and sides of the pan. Quickly and carefully pour
the batter into the pan and return the pan to the oven. Bake for
12-15 minutes, until the pancake is golden brown and has puffed up.
turn off oven.

**Final Prep: Evenly distribute the grated cheese over the warm Dutch baby
pancake. Pop back in oven for a minute or so.  Remove and top with
onions and veggies or prosciutto.
