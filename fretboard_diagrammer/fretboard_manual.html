    <p>To start, This is an adaptation of Tobias Kolditz's splendid little
    <i>Fretboard Diagram Creator</i>. I've added many extra features to it to
    allow other kinds of fretboards amongst other things. The <a
    href="LICENSE.txt">original (MIT style) copyright</a> allows free
    use and modifications. Thank you Tobias! </p>

<h3>Diagram Creation</h3>

<h4>Setting the type of fretboard you want to work with</h4>
<p>
The selection box on the bottom row of the menu allows you to 
pick a type of fretboard you want to diagram. 
<p>This sets the number of strings and their tunings.

<h4>Setting the area of the fretboard to diagram</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Use the two (start and end) numeric entry fields to set the range
    of frets you wish to diagram. You can change this later if desired
    </ul>

    <p>
    You'll notice some numeric fret numbers along the bottom edge
    of the fretboard diagram. These numbers are markers that
    correspond to frets that have associated navigation inlays on
    the fretboard. They will vary depending on the type of fretboard.

<h4>Setting the default sharp/flat symbol</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Use the sharp/flat toggle button to toggle the notes to show sharps
    or flats. You can change this as you are editing. Additionally, you won't be forced to
    use all sharps or all flats</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Selecting Fretboard string/fret locations to diagram</h4>

    <p>The fretboard starts with a matrix of "unactivated" string/fret
    location dots on the fretboard. 
    <ul>
	<li>Clicking  on a dot will 'activate it' and make it part
	of your final diagram it also 'selects' it to be the current
	target of editing operations that you can do using the
	editing tool buttons below the fretboard grid

	<li>Clicking on the [X] will clear out any changes you made
	to the selected dot and 'deactivate' it from the diagram. you can
	re-activate it by clicking on it again.
    </ul>

<h4>Show intervals with relation to a selected position</h4>
    <p>Switch the fretboard to show positions on the fretboard
    as intervals of a root postion by selecting a position on the
    and then clicking the Interval [<-->] button

    <p>Use the [sharp/flat] toggle button to revert the display back
    to it's normal mode.

<h4>Editing the location dots</h4>

    <h5>Changing the color</h5>
    <ul>
    <li> The middle row of colored <i>quickcolor</i> buttons 
    change the color of the selected position dot with single click</li>
        <ul>
        <li>
        You can change color value for a quickcolor button by 
        &lt;shift&gt;&lt;click&gt;-ing on the button and selecting a new color
        from the pop-up color menu.

        <li>
	The are keyboard shortcuts for selecting quick colors.<br>Keys
	&lt;Shift-1&gt; .. &lt;Shift-5&gt;<br> correspond with the 4
	quickcolor buttons from left to right.  </ul>


    <li> The [Color...] button brings up a color
    selection menu that allows you to select a color beyond the four
    quickcolor's for the selected position dot.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Changing the shape</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>
    The top row of shape buttons change the shape of the dots to other shapes
    this is typically used for finger symbols
        <ul>
        <li>Circle for 1st (index) finger
        <li>Diamond for 2nd finger
        <li>Triangle for 3rd finger
        <li>Square for 4th finger
        </ul>
    <li>
    The keys <code>|1| .. |4|</code> (<code>Circle .. Square</code>) 
    can also be used as shortcuts for setting the shape.
    </ul>

    <h5>Changing the text</h5>
    <ul>
    <li> The text inside the dots can be edited by double clicking
    on the location.  You're limited (practically) to a few characters
    due to the size of the dot. the text will be preserved when you
    switch display modes or until you reset it with the [X] button.
    </li>
    </ul>

<h4>Displaying unactivated location dots</h4>
    The Toggle button <br>
    <br/><img width="32" height="32" src="svg-icons/cycle.svg" /> 
    <p>
    toggles the display of unactivated location dots
    If the unactivated dots are toggled off, you can still activate them
    by just clicking in the area of the fretboard where you nomally see them

<h4>Clearing the fretboard</h4>
    You can clear the fretboard to an empty state by clicking the
    [Reset] Button. It will ask you if you really want to.
