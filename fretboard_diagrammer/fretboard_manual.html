<h1>Fretboard Diagram Creator Manual</h1>
<hr>

    <p> Some basic instructions to get you started.
    <a href="fretboard.html" target="popup">Launch the creator</a>
    for reference you as you read this.

    <p> <blockquote>
    <i>
    Right now this app is in early evaluation / test phase.
    </i>

    <p> There's currently only one fretboard configuration available which
    is the Melody Side of a 12 string matched recripocal tapping
    instrument. I've tested multiple other types of fretboards like
    a standard guitar and a full 12 string tapping instrument set
    up, but there's no easy way to select one from the user interface
    yet.

<h2>Basics</h2>

<h3>Diagram management</h3>

    <p>In the spirit of keeping the creator simple, there are no
    features for retrieving a diagram for later editing. Creating a
    diagram is a very simple and quick process. If you need to
    fix or alter a diagram just make a new one. It will likely
    take you only a minute or two to do so.

    <p>At any time while creating a diagram, you can download it
    as a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG>SVG file</a>
    using the Save button in the button area below the fretboard
    grid.
    <p>You can then embed SVG files into web pages or read it into other  
    editors like Illustrator

    <p> <blockquote> <i>NOTE! If you refresh the page before saving
    you'll lose your creation!</i> </blockquote>

<h3>Diagram Creation</h3>

<h4>Setting the type of fretboard you want to work with</h4>
<p>
The selection box on the bottom row of the menu allows you to 
pick a type of fretboard you want to diagram. 
<p>This sets the number of strings and their tunings.

<h4>Setting the area of the fretboard to diagram</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Use the two (start and end) numeric entry fields to set the range
    of frets you wish to diagram. You can change this later if desired
    </ul>

    <p>
    You'll notice some numeric fret numbers along the bottom edge
    of the fretboard diagram. These numbers are markers that
    correspond to frets that have associated navigation inlays on
    the fretboard. They will vary depending on the type of fretboard.

<h4>Setting the default sharp/flat symbol</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Use the sharp/flat toggle button to toggle the notes to show sharps
    or flats. You can change this as you are editing. Additionally, you won't be forced to
    use all sharps or all flats</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Selecting Fretboard string/fret locations to diagram</h4>

    <p>The fretboard starts with a matrix of "unactivated" string/fret
    location dots on the fretboard. 
    <ul>
	<li>Clicking  on a dot will 'activate it' and make it part
	of your final diagram it also 'selects' it to be the current
	target of editing operations that you can do using the
	editing tool buttons below the fretboard grid

	<li>Clicking on the [X] will clear out any changes you made
	to the selected dot and 'deactivate' it from the diagram. you can
	re-activate it by clicking on it again.
    </ul>

<h4>Show intervals with relation to a selected position</h4>
    <p>Switch the fretboard to show positions on the fretboard
    as intervals of a root postion by selecting a position on the
    and then clicking the Interval [<-->] button

    <p>Use the [sharp/flat] toggle button to revert the display back
    to it's normal mode.

<h4>Editing the location dots</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> The middle row of colored buttons change the color of the
    selected position dot
    </li>

    <li>
    The top row of shape buttons change the shape of the dots to other shapes
    this is typically used to finger symbols
        <ul>
        <li>Circle for 1st (index) finger
        <li>Diamond for 2nd finger
        <li>Triangle for 3rd finger
        <li>Square for 4th finger
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li> The text inside the dots can be edited by double clicking
    on the location.  You're limited (practically) to a few characters
    due to the size of the dot. the text will be preserved when you
    switch display modes or until you reset it with the [X] button.
    </li>

    </ul>

<h4>Displaying unactivated location dots</h4>
    The Toggle button toggles the display of unactivated location dots
    If the unactivated dots are toggled off, you can still activate them
    by just clicking in the area of the fretboard where you nomally see them

<h4>Clearing the fretboard</h4>
    You can clear the fretboard to an empty state by clicking the
    [Reset] Button. It will ask you if you really want to.

<h3>Key Commands</h4>
    <p> You can operate most of the buttons used to edit a selection
    with keyboard commands
